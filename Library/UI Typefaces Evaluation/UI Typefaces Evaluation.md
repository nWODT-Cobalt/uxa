# UI Typeface Evaluation

<!--BREAK-->

## Checklist

<!-- What to look for when evaluating/reviewing UI typefaces. -->

**Letterforms**

- Tall x-height
- Open counters, big bowls
- Differentiation of ambiguous glyphs (`aceo`, `Il1`, `o0`, etc.)
- Simplicity of knotty glyphs (`a`, `g`, `1`, `7`, etc.)

<!-- Even color, active texture -->

**Features**

- Proportional and monospace numerals
- Sub/sup numerals
- Fractions
- Small caps

Optional:

- Lining and historical numerals
- Alternate styles (on a few characters)
- Grading

**Range**

- Many weights (minimum 5-6 or even better, a dedicated variable axis)
- Part of a super family (matching condensed, extended, display, serif, mono etc.)

**Charset**

- Script for any language the product is in
- Script for Greek (for scientific notation)
- Bonus glyphs (arrows, dingbats, boxed numbers etc.)

**Implementation**

- Variable format
- Optical sizes
- Line-height to x-height ratio and position

**Feel**

- Feel on labels and running copy, at UI sizes (12â€“48 px)

<!-- build own specimen; possibly in several sections: 1 for feel, 1 for all the attributes -->
