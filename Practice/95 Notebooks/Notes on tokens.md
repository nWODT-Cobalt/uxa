## Design Tokens Only Exist In A Pre-Processed State

Once compiled and transformed, the output is no longer a design token. Instead, it's simply what it is: a key value pair fit for the platform. A variable in a form the platform can understand.

The reason for this conclusion is because the purpose of a design token is to exist as a value, surrounded by context, ready to be transformed. When the design token goes through that transform process, it will inevitably lose nearly all of its meta information. That meta information is very important: it provides context to the token and instructions for how that token should be transformed.

*E.g. le token initial pourrait avoir une value de transparence, qui serait perdue sur des plate-formes ne supportant que le hex.*

- Design tokens are a methodology to extract design decisions into a separate space. They are stored technology agnostic to be used on any platform.
- The two types of design tokens are choices & decisions.
- Choices are the available primitives like brand colors
- Decisions are choices applied to a context, e.g. what color is used for a primary button
- Continued interest in design tokens will bring better design software integrations and improved development tooling.
- Design tokens help have 4 main benefits
	- Design consistency across products
	- Improved maintainability
	- Help scale products to other platforms
	- Improve documentation of design decisions
