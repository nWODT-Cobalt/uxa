Pedagogical, reference or evangelization material for **User Experience Architecture** practitioners.

This material aims to support UI, UX or product designers working at scale, and helping others in an organization to do so. It covers topics like design systems, design principles, tokens, components, semantics, creativity techniques, applied cognition, etc.

It's very much an early, ongoing work.

## Content

Each presentation or document is exported as PDF, ready to be used, albeit without presenter notes.

- `Practice`: pedagogical, reference or evangelization material
    - `Presentations`: slide decks
    - `Documents`: long form writing
    - `Sources`: source files for illustrations
    - `Notebooks`: staging for work in progress
- `Resources`: templates, themes, fonts, styleguides etc, to render or edit `Practice` content

## Dependencies

Dependencies only kick in when rendering the material live, or editing it.
Otherwise, the material is available as PDF and can be used as is.

### For Consumption

Presentations are rendered with [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/), documents with [Marked](https://marked2app.com/).
Both use [ia Writer](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) fonts.

### For Edition

Text content and document wrappers are stored in Markdown `.md` files. They are plain text files, modifiable with any text editor (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

Most illustrations are made with [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (`.sketch` files). Some bitmaps are processed beforehand in [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) (`.pxd` files).
