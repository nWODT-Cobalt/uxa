Pedagogical, reference or evangelization material for **User Experience Architecture** practitioners.

This material aims to support UI, UX or product designers working at scale, and helping others in an organization to do so. It covers topics like design systems, design principles, tokens, components, semantics, creativity techniques, applied cognition, etc.

It's very much an early, ongoing work. The initial focus is on defining basic notions to facilitate conversation.

## Content

Each document or presentation is exported as PDF, ready to be used, albeit without presenter notes.

- `Documents`: long form writing
- `Presentations`: slide decks
- `Resources`: templates, themes, fonts, style guides etc to render or edit documents and presentation
- `Sources`: source files for illustrations
- `WIP`: work in progress

## Dependencies

Dependencies only kick in when rendering the material live, or editing it.
Otherwise, the material is available as PDF and can be used as is.

### For Rendering

Presentations are rendered with [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/), documents with [Marked](https://marked2app.com/).
Both use [ia Writer](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) fonts.

### For Editing

Text content and document wrappers are stored in Markdown (`.md` files), modifiable with any text editor.

Most illustrations are made with [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (`.sketch` files). Some bitmaps are processed beforehand in [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) (`.pxd` files).
