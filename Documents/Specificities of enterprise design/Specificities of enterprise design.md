# A tentative look at the specificities of enterprise design

<!--BREAK-->

Whatever it is, “enterprise design” is different from consumer, e-commerce, product, social, community, blogging, news, etc design.
Here’s a tentative list of practice/outcomes/considerations which are important in “enterprise design”, compared to other fields of UX design:

<!-- B2B RWA -->
<!-- tactical level -->
<!-- For new designers, or otherwise experienced designers or design managers looking to work in the field. -->

- Accessibility
- Brand
- Compliance (whether to internal guidelines, or external ones like legal or industry standards)
- Frameworks
- Internationalization
- Interplay
- Platforms
- Scalability
- White-labeling
- 3rd party integration
- 3rd party support

<!-- Framework (fwk): a black-box genie’s lamp lol service deterministically prescribing a holistic design solution (where, how, when, who; not what) who/what/where/when/how  for cross-suite features fed a complex use case.
They’re partially or completely automated;  through templating, governance and programmation. They’re owned and operated by suitex designers. -->

This can be achieved through:

- Business processes
- Composability
- Configurability (wide and deep, from component props to full-on admin areas)
- Interfacing
- Modularity
- Multi-channeling
- Orchestration
- Platforms
- Portability
- Themeability

<!-- incl. branding, etc; some customers will have deep customization/deviance, and will tend to produce more content/transactions then B2C products, where user input is minimal or heavily controlled) -->

<!--
As opposed to:

- Layout
- Responsiveness
- Style
- Perceived quality
- Perceived novelty

(They are still there, but their relative importance is lower)
-->

<!--
At a higher level:

- Co-strategy
- Governance
- Partnerships
-->

<!--
Knowing that the ecological context is different since:
- The buyers aren't the users, the users aren't the buyers
- The user devices, apps, networks etc can be company-provided and/or controlled -->
