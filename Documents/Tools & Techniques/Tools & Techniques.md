*An outline of not-necessarily trivial tools for UXA, either sought or found.*
*Updated infrequently, not to be complete nor completed.*

## Needed

*Tools seemingly missing for recurring tasks.*

### Decision tree builder/navigator

### Karnaugh table solver

### Gif maker

Most illos should actually be gifs or videos; let's make it easy to make them.

### Progressive disclosure

In many ways, e.g:

- Click word in a sentence to expand it. The expanded version provides more details, but still works within the initial sentence.
- Hover to instantly reveal (even for multimedia, cf <https://www.twohydesign.works/>)
- Mind mapping?

### n-tables

Tables/matrixes with more than 2 dimensions.  
Actually, even 2-tables in design tools (i.e. real tables with row/column management etc not just rectangles faking it).

#update 2D tables added to FigJam.

### Typographic specimen

A way to quickly gauge the feel/capabilities of a font for UI purposes, and check or complete vendor claims. Single face, no comparison nor pairing.

Should check for:

- "Feel" on lines and running copy @ UI sizes (12â€“48). See specimens:
    - <https://www.impallari.com/testing/>
    - <http://lthscomputerart2.weebly.com/type-specimen-poster-design.html>
    - <http://webfontspecimen.com/>
    - <https://www.typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts>
- Morphology (x-height, counters and bowls, glyph differenciation, line-height positioning etc.)
- Small caps
- Weights
- Grading
- Variable axis
- ~Variants (condensed, extended, stencil etc.)
- Alternate styles
- Numerals (proportional vs mono, lining vs historical, sub/sup scripts etc.)
- Scripts/languages support (vs product needs, but also greek/latin for math et al.)

A start:

- <https://fontdrop.info/>
- <https://www.underware.nl/latin_plus/validate/>
- <https://www.alphabet-type.com/tools/charset-checker/>

### Interactive lecturer

"Magic paper" where figures/tables/prototypes:

- Are easily embeddable
- Remain in the viewport as long as needed, while accompanying text can ~scroll as needed
- "React" in context of the reading
- Can turn into interactive playgrounds

E.g:

- <https://www.nan.fyi/>
- <https://www.nathanmanousos.com/posts/chonky-menu>
