*Not-necessarily trivial tools for UXA, either sought or found.*
*Updated infrequently, not to be complete nor completed.*

## Needed

*Tools seemingly missing for recurring tasks.*

### AI linter

Fed by `Communication Guidelines` et al; doing QA on write-ups and design files.

### AI conversation prototyper

How to visually sketch conversational flows (including branching, conditionality, parameterization etc). Then how to have it interactive. Then live, hooked to a real service.

Ideally x-raying intents, who provides what data/services etc.

### Color System

Proper color generation/compliance tool etc eg P1 and OKlab. Color space transformations. Derivation with constant S, L or contrast ratios, uniform steps, predictable interpolations etc.

### Decision tree builder/navigator

### Karnaugh table solver

### Gif maker

Most illos should actually be gifs or videos; let's make it easy to make them.

### Progressive disclosure

In many ways, e.g:

- Click word in a sentence to expand it. The expanded version provides more details, but still works within the initial sentence.
- Hover to instantly reveal (even for multimedia, cf <https://www.twohydesign.works/>)
- Mind mapping?

### n-tables

Tables/matrixes with more than 2 dimensions.  
Actually, even 2-tables in design tools (i.e. real tables with row/column management etc not just rectangles faking it).

### Interactive lecturer

"Magic paper" where figures/tables/prototypes:

- Are easily embeddable
- Remain in the viewport as long as needed, while accompanying text can ~scroll as needed
- "React" in context of the reading
- Can turn into interactive playgrounds

E.g:

### KJ / Affinity Diagrams

Wouldn't mind a good starting template + time per step f(# of participants.)

### State Charts

state-diagrams + depth + orthogonality + broadcast-communication (+ automatic resolution thereof)

### Structured screenshots gallery

Being able to capture quickly a full page + name + URL of any web/app. Then have it tagged or matrixed for easy comparison/retrieval.

### Misc charts

Nothing crazy, just a handy list of usually useful visual formalisms. Otherwise it's easy to miss a really convenient chart type in the heat of the moment.

- 2x2 matrices
- Euler charts
- Sequential diagrams (grafcet-like)
