# Cataxonomies

<!-- Cacaxonomies -->

## Definition

**Cataxonomy: excessive labeling that ends up impairing communication.**

An accumulation of words that are technically true, but don’t immediately drive action or decision.

Worse, their presence and vagueness slow down the conversation, by only adding noise to it.

<!-- Avoid cataxonomies. -->

^Note that this isn’t “ill defined” nor “untrue”, it’s “irrelevant”. The words can be 100% true, they are just useless. “Ok cool. Now what?”.

<!-- Hot take: Atomic Design is a cataxonomy for UX practitioners. -->

## Best Practices: Spotting

- Overly generic words that describe a concept rather than an attribute
- Overly domain-specific words
- Cool sounding words, and lot of them at once
- Single-use words disproportionately set to one value

<!-- Everything-bucket terms without a local definition -->

<!-- buzzwords -->

<!-- Red flag, polysemic -->

^A.k.a. the no-no list: “framework”, “platform”, “system”, “workspace”, etc.

---

## Best Practices: Fixing

- Check for up-to-dateness, wholeness, concision and consistency
- Remove problematic words
- Evaluate whether problematic words need replacement at all;
if yes break them down, replace them with generic alternative, or define them locally

^If the authors get sentimental (e.g. afraid to “lose” something, or feeling that “we worked a lot on that”), problematic words can be moved to drafts or archives rather than outright deleted. The point is to remove them from taxonomy consumers’ point of view.

Cataxonomies are often a symptom of a weak underlying conceptual model. Consider fixing the model first.

## Best Practices: Preventing

- Ensure a clear scope, goals and ideally perspective
- Curate and maintain continuously
- Consider formats that could handle better some or all of the content: flowcharts, figures, post-it boards, terminology, etc.

^Perspective: that of stakeholders x-y-or-z, users, technical dependencies, etc.
