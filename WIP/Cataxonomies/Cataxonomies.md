# Cataxonomies

---

## Definition

**An accidental excess of labeling and categorizing things, that ends up impairing communication more than helping it.**

Labeling/categorizing/describing that while technically true, isn't immediately actionable.
It is therefore just noise, and ultimately has no other impact on operations than slowness and confusion.

## Example

car rental app.
1 screen of silly filters (eg body color, country of origin, diameters of electrical wiring), clearly overflowing with bad choices with just of hint of a good one + 1 screen of silly details (eg name of assembly line workers, stitching pattern of the seats, has never carried goats, maybe meerkat friendly)
better than filters (?)

## Best Practices

How to detect cataxonomies:

Recommendation/what to do: drop altogether. If a hint of value: extract the actual criteria, expose and define it, must/could/should its consequences. At worst, archive the noise (in case ppl are afraid to "lose" something) so that "makers" can still tap into it, but "consumers" are spared.
