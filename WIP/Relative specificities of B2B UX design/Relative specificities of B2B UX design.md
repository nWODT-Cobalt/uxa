# Relative specificities of B2B UX design

<!--BREAK-->

A non-normative reminder/~introduction/enumeration of the specificities of ux design for enterprise design practice/outcomes/considerations at the tactical level

For otherwise experienced designers or design managers looking to work in EDX / B2B UX design

« Enterprise design » is xxx, as opposed/compared to e-commerce, product pitch/brochure, social, community etc.
Of course no offering is a single type over the others

Areas that are often comparatively/disproportionately more important :

- Interplay
- Scale
- Compliance (eg legal or internal)
- Internationalization
- Accessibility
- Brand
- White-labeling
- Platforms
- Frameworks
- 3rd party integration
- 3rd party support

Through:

- Composability
- Portability
- Configurability
- Modularity
- Interfacing
- Orchestration
- Multi-channeling
- Admin areas

<!-- As opposed to:

- Layout
- Responsiveness
- Style
- Perceived quality
- Perceived novelty

(They are still there, but their relative importance is lower) -->

NB very connected to but still different from UXA or the fluffy « [enterprise design](http://enterprisearchitects.com/enterprise-design-fad-or-wicked-opportunity/) »

At a higher level: governance, partnerships, co-strategy etc.
