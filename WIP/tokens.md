- Design tokens are a methodology to extract design decisions into a separate space. They are stored technology agnostic to be used on any platform.
- The two types of design tokens are choices & decisions.
- Choices are the available primitives like brand colors
- Decisions are choices applied to a context, e.g. what color is used for a primary button
- Continued interest in design tokens will bring better design software integrations and improved development tooling.
- Design tokens help have 4 main benefits
	- Design consistency across products
	- Improved maintainability
	- Help scale products to other platforms
	- Improve documentation of design decisions
