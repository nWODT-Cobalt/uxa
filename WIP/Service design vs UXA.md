# Service design vs UXA

*A relative definition.*

## Terminology

Service design
: A broad design practice with a particular focus on organizing the resources of a business (not just its design org) to better serve customers, through end-to-end customer journey, customer-to-employee interactions, and customer touchpoints beyond screens. Specific activities and deliverables in support thereof.

UXA
: User Experience Architecture. A perspective on user experience at scale: across time, product lines, use cases, audiences, channels, etc; internally, across business units and disciplines. Coming up with a vision to “shape” that scale into an actionable strategy. Advocacy, teams and processes in support thereof.

Service
: A term with several meanings in the industry. Hereafter it is service as “the external offerings of a business”, not as “the internal capabilities accessible through an API”.

## Comparison

Overall those are different practices, that can have significant overlap.

It is possible to do service design without formal UXA. Not all services have to be huge or all-encompassing. Even when they do have a big scale, services can be expressed and acted upon through their own deliverables. E.g. you could service blueprint the “employee self-scheduling” offering as is, without further ado.

It is possible to do UXA without formal service design *(that’s what we’ve done so far, and we’re far from having hit a wall!)*. A lot of what needs to scale doesn’t have to do with a direct touchpoint between a customer and the company’s products. E.g. you could build a complete messaging framework, of which the end user will only see the very narrow filtered output.

Both practices cover slightly different but related needs, and thus exist at once, and will eventually consume, contribute to, or enact activities from the other.

## Hot takes

- Empirically, “service design” has seemed to be an attempt to package differently the UX process, to better sell to decision-makers and avoid having the UX practitioners relegated to usability suppliers. Much like IDEO coined “design thinking” to get out of being ad-hod project suppletives.
- Currently, I’d consider service design a point activity in the toolbox, rather than a distinct function. Much like we frequently tap into object-oriented UX, customer experience design, inclusive design etc.
