color picking + color palettes generation for complex product

quantify + show why "more white more black or transparency" doesn't work

contrast ratio as a proxy for perceived presence etc

anchor on a couple hypothesis. what matters is:

1. contrast ratio guarantee etc
2. perceptual consistency (vs "our S is consistent, our L is consistent" ok cool, makes for different charts, but what does the user see?) compounded by the fact that neither color spaces nor human perception are linear (eg easier to tell apart lighter greys)

Corollary: a word about color reproduction, eg color spaces and monitors. to 1: make sure the article can be read/understood properly 2. tailor output to end-customer context (eg sim != mobile app != embedded software etc)
